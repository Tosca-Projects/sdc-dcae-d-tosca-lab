TOSCA Lab

Ideally, I try to make TOSCA Lab like Matlab, a tool set to create/modify/connect/translate TOSCA templates. 

It is also my first Python project for coding practice. 

Version: 
0.1 -- The original version was created to write everything from scratch. It is able to read YAML files following TOSCA standard and do TOSCA-to-HEAT translation provided with the translation library. 
0.2 -- I will try to integrate with the existing open source project tosca-parser. In that case, I can make full use of the existing parser and focus more on more features.  The tosca-parser version I am working with is 0.4.0
